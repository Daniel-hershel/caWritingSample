> The building blocks of JavaScript make up every program and line of JavaScript.
Just like a language has nouns, verbs, and prepositions, JavaScript has its own building blocks. Instead of calling them building blocks, however, developers call them data types. 
There are three essential data types to know for now, and here is your first test of memorization (don't worry, we will practice):
String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
Boolean: This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.
Let's review: a string is any grouping of words, a number's a number, and a boolean is a ghostly halloween costume. Or no, that's false! It's either true or false.

- Breaking Down The Flow
    - introduce the javascript idea
    - explain it
    - connect it to code
    - review it
    - propose a problem for the user to 'solve' using what they just learned


## Outline

- given an array
    + or make an array
- do stuff to it
- have users follow instructions to learn and use some built in methods for arrays
    + methods
        * filter
        * sort
        * map
- and then have them look throug array js documentation
    + choose (maybe from a list) 1 or 2 additional methods to call on their array
    
>"It is important for learners to be able to both identify the use cases of the most important iteration methods as well as be able to find new ones using documentation.""
